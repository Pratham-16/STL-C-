# 🚀 Mastering STL (Standard Template Library)

Welcome to my **STL Learning Repository**! This repository contains my journey of exploring **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)** with various implementations and examples.

## 🔥 Why Learn STL?
STL is a powerful feature of C++ that provides a collection of ready-to-use **data structures and algorithms**, making coding **efficient and optimized**. It consists of:

- **Containers** 📦 (Vector, List, Deque, Set, Map, etc.)
- **Algorithms** ⚙️ (Sorting, Searching, etc.)
- **Iterators** 🔄 (To traverse containers efficiently)
- **Function Objects** 🔢 (For custom operations)

## 📁 What’s Inside?
This repository includes STL-based implementations such as:
✅ Vectors & Lists  
✅ Maps & Sets  
✅ Stack & Queue  
✅ Sorting & Searching Algorithms  
✅ Custom Comparators & Functors  

## 📜 How to Use?
Clone the repository and compile any file to explore STL:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/STL-Learning.git  
cd STL-Learning  
g++ filename.cpp -o output  
./output  
```
